Portfolio Website Template
This is a simple responsive portfolio website. You can use it and make it yours by changing things and colors to your style and liking! I made it with a lot of hard work, love and of course with code. I'm not a professional coder, but i tried my best to make it look cool and yet still keep it simple. While working with JS i got many errors, but thanks to some help from friends.

Mistakes are proof that we are trying!

I learned so much while making this website, if you use it, please let me know. I would love to see how amazing people can make it! I hope you'll like it!

I have used:
HTML5 for markup
Pure CSS3 for styling
Bit of Jquery to make header animation effects work
Bit of JavaScript to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices
Font Awesome for Icons
You can add more things to make it even cooler! The comments in the code will help you navigate through it. Have a nice day!
